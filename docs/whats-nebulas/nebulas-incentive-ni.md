# Nebulas Incentive \(NI\)

Nebulas Incentive include Proof of Devotion \(PoD\) and Developer Incentive Protocol \(DIP\).

## **Proof-of-Devotion \(PoD\)**

Based on Nebulas’ NR system, we shall adopt PoD \(Proof-of-Devotion\) consensus algorithm. PoD gives an “influential” user of Nebulas Blockchain an opportunity to become a bookkeeper and receive Nebulas’ block rewards and transaction fee as revenues, which will encourage them to contribute to Nebulas’ stability and security continuously.

## **Developer Incentive Protocol \(DIP\)**

In Nebulas, we propose the concept of DIP \(Developer Incentive Protocol\) for developers of smart contracts and DApps. DIP’s core concept: in pre-specified blocks’ interval, for those developers whose smart contracts and DApps deploy online in the most recent interval with NR value higher than a specified threshold, DIP shall reward them corresponding developer incentives \(NAS token\), and these incentives shall be recorded on blocks by bookkeepers. With DIP’s positive incentive mechanism, more and more developers get incentives to create valuable smart contracts and DApps, which helps to build a positive feedback ecosystem for the developers’ community.
