# Nebulas Force \(NF\)

A series of basic protocols such as NR, PoD, DIP shall become a part of blockchain data. With the growth of data on Nebulas, these basic protocols will upgrade, and this will avoid fracture between developers and community as well as the “fork”. We call this fundamental capability of blockchain “Nebulas Force” \(NF\).

As Nebulas community grows, NF and basic protocols’ update ability shall be open to the community. According to users’ NR weight and community voting mechanism, the community determines Nebulas’ evolution direction and its update objectives. With the help of NF’s core technology and its openness, Nebulas will have ever-growing evolving potential and infinite evolving possibilities endlessly.
