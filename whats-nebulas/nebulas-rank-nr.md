# Nebulas Rank \(NR\)

Nebulas Rank \(NR\) is an open sourced ranking algorithm used to measure the influence of relationships among addresses, smart contracts, and distributed applications \(DApps\). It helps both users utilize information among the ever-increasing amount of data on all blockchains & developers to use our search framework directly in their own applications.

In Nebulas, we measure value regarding:

* **Liquidity**

Finance essentially is the social activities which optimize social resources via capital liquidity and promote economic development. Blockchains establish a value network in which the financial assets can flow. Daily volume of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are most familiar to us, already exceeds $1 billion. From these data, we can see that the more transaction volume and transaction scale, the higher liquidity. In turn, higher liquidity will increase the quantity of transaction and enhance the value. That will further strengthen financial assets’ value, creating a complete positive feedback mechanism. Therefore liquidity, i.e. transaction frequency and scale, is the first dimension that NR measures.

* **Propagation**

Social platforms like WeChat and Facebook have almost 3 billion active users per month. Social platforms’ rapid user growth is a result of the reflection of existing social network and stronger viral growth. In particular, viral transmission, i.e. speed, scope, depth of information transmission and linkage, is the key index to monitor social network’s quality and user growth. In blockchain world, we can see the same pattern. Powerful viral propagation indicates scope and depth of asset liquidity, which can promote the blockchain world’s asset quality and asset scale. Thus, viral transmission, i.e. scope and depth of asset liquidity, is the second dimension that NR measures.

* **Interoperability**

At Internet’s early stage, there are only basic websites and private information. Now, information on different platforms can be forwarded on the network, and isolated data silos are gradually being broken. This trend is the process of identifying higher dimensional information. In our point of view, the world of blockchains shall follow a similar pattern, but its speed will be faster. The information on users’ assets, smart contracts, and DApps will become richer, and the interaction of higher dimensional information shall be more frequent, thus better interoperability shall become more and more important. Therefore, NR’s third measure dimension is interoperability.

Based on above-stated dimensions, we start to construct Nebulas’ NR system by drawing from richer data, building a better model, digging up more diversified value dimensions, and establishing a measure of value in blockchain world.
